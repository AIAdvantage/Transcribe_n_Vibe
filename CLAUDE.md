- Using the API - Getting started: The API is accessed via the web Console. Use Workbench to try the API in browser and generate API keys in Account Settings. Use workspaces to segment API keys and control spend by use case. Authentication requires an x-api-key header with your API key. Client SDKs handle this automatically. The API accepts and returns JSON content (content-type: application/json header required). Response headers include request-id and anthropic-organization-id. Example curl request uses model "claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219" with max_tokens and message content.
